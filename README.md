# memory-and-prediction-timeline
Tutorials and code examples for constructing a scale-free log-compressed memory timeline and from that  a scale-free log-compressed timeline of the estimated future. 

For a very basic demo of scale-free log-compressed dynamic memory look into compressed_memory.m. The code provides an example for storing multiple repetitions of a single stimulus over 10000 time units in 50 log-spaced buffers. 
The output figure illustrates how the input is compressed through a two-layer network.
